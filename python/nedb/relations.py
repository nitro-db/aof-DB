nedb.relations — first-class, time-travel-aware relations (the graph layer).

Relations are stored as adjacency lists for O(1) traversal. Each edge records the
seq at which it was added and (optionally) removed, so relation queries can also be
asked "AS OF" any past sequence — the graph time-travels just like the records do.
