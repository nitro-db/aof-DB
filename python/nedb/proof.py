nedb.proof — Merkle inclusion proofs for the hash-chained op log.

Every NEDB write produces an Op whose ``hash`` field is the chain head after that op
(``op.hash = blake2b(prev_head.utf8 + canon(body))`` — see ``nedb.log``). The chain
head therefore commits cryptographically to the entire write history.

This module derives a *parallel*, compact Merkle commitment chain over the same
op-hash sequence so a client can verify — offline, with no server round-trip and
without re-running the engine — that a specific op-hash was at a specific seq in
the log, and that the log's head followed from chaining all subsequent op-hashes
on top of it.

The chain step used by both ``verify_proof`` (client) and the server endpoint is::

    head_next = blake2b(bytes.fromhex(head_prev) || bytes.fromhex(op_hash)).hexdigest()

starting from the genesis head (the all-zero 32-byte string). Folding over the
full ordered list of op-hashes yields a deterministic head; tamper with any op
hash (or reorder ops) and the fold no longer matches. The Op's own ``hash`` field
already commits to its body (payload, seq, nonce, ts, …) under the engine's chain
formula, so this fold is a complete commitment to the write history through the
op-hashes alone — exactly the property a Merkle inclusion proof needs.

The fold's terminal value (``proof["head"]``) is a *derived* head, distinct from
``db.head`` (the engine's UTF-8-hex chain) but a deterministic function of the
same log. The server computes the derived head over the live log when issuing
each proof, so any divergence between client fold and server fold means the
proof was tampered with in transit.
